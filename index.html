			<p>You have a <input id='width' type='number' min='3' max='11' value='3' size='2' /> by <input id='height' type='number' min='3' max='11' value='3' size='2' /> grid. You want to create a path of increasing numbers from the first to the last field that follows the arrows. To do that, starting <select id='corner_start'><option value='1'>in a corner</option><option value='0'>somewhere</option></select> with <em>1</em> you drag its arrow to the field you want to label <em>2</em> and so on. Drag with the right mouse button to draw reversed arrows. When dragging from an empty field, you create a hint for yourself. The blue numbers are hints from the game, the red numbers are definitely wrong. <button id='play'>Better try it.</button></p>
